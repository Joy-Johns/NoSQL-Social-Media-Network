  ## Installation
  npm i
  npm run start

  ## Usage
  This application is to be used for socialization purposes only. It is a place for creating positive connections with one another. We do not accept negative thoughts or reactions to others. That is the fastest way to get your account removed.To get started, I've included an instructional tutorial on how to navigate this API.
